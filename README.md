# Python-practice
It's easy to forget how to code when not done often. I really like Python and want to learn it efficiently so I like to practice simple concepts repeatedly to learn them permanently.

- loopsPractice.py contains for/while/nested-loops practice
- writeFile.py prompts the user for a firstname and birthdate. Script then creates a file in current directory named after the user name and writes the provided birthdate on a single line.
- printEvenLines.py prints only the even lines from an input file provided as an argument (assumes first line is line 1).
